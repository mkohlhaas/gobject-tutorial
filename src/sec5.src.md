# Properties

GObject system provides properties.
Properties are values kept by instances, which is a descendant of GObject, and they are open to other instances.
They can be accessed with their names.

For example, GtkWindow has "title", "default-width", "default-height" and other properties.
The string "title" is the name of the property.
The name of a property is a string that begins with a letter followed by letters, digits, dash ('-') or underscore ('_').
Dash and underscore is used as separators but they cannot be mixed.
Using dash is more efficient than underscore.
For example, "value", "double" and "double-value" are correct property names.
"\_value" or "-value" are incorrect.

Properties have various types of values.
The type of "title" property is string.
The type of "default-width" and "default-height" is integer.

Properties are set and got with functions defined in GObject.

- Properties can be set with several GObject functions.
`g_object_new` and `g_object_set` are often used.
- Properties can be get with several GObject functions.
`g_object_get` is often used.

The functions above belongs to GObject, but they can be used for any descendant object of GObject.
The following is an example of GtkWindow, which is a descendant object of GObject.

An instance is created and its properties are set with `g_object_new`.

~~~C
GtkWindow *win;
win = g_object_new (GTK_TYPE_WINDOW, "title", "Hello", "default-width", 800, "default-height", 600, NULL);
~~~

The example above creates an instance of GtkWindow and sets the properties.

- The "title" property is set to "Hello".
- The "default-width" property is set to 800.
- The "default-height" property is set to 600.

The last parameter of `g_object_new` is `NULL` which is the end of the list of properties.

If you have already created a GtkWindow instance and you want to set its title, you can use `g_object_set`.

~~~C
GtkWindow *win;
win = g_object_new (GTK_TYPE_WINDOW, NULL);
g_object_set (win, "title", "Good bye", NULL);
~~~

You can get the value of a property with `g_object_get`.

~~~C
GtkWindow *win;
char *title;
int width, height;

win = g_object_new (GTK_TYPE_WINDOW, "title", "Hello", "default-width", 800, "default-height", 600, NULL);
g_object_get (win, "title", &title, "default-width", &width, "default-height", &height, NULL);
g_print ("%s, %d, %d\n", title, width, height);
g_free (title);
~~~

The rest of this section is about implementing properties in a descendant of GObject.
It is divided into two things.

- Register a property
- Define `set_property` and `get_property` class method to complement `g_object_set` and `g_object_get`.

## GParamSpec

GParamSpec is a fundamental object.
GParamSpec and GObject don't have parent-child relationship.
GParamSpec has information of parameters.
"ParamSpec" is short for "Parameter specification".

For example,

~~~C
double_property = g_param_spec_double ("value", "val", "Double value",
                                       -G_MAXDOUBLE, G_MAXDOUBLE, 0.0,
                                        G_PARAM_READWRITE);
~~~

This function creates a GParamSpec instance, more precisely a GParamSpecDouble instance.
GParamSpecDouble is a child of GParamSpec.

The instance has information:

- The value type is double.
The suffix of the function name, `double` in `g_param_spec_double`, implies the type.
- The name is "value".
- The nick name is "val".
- The description is "Double value".
- The minimum value is -G\_MAXDOUBLE.
G\_MAXDOUBLE is the maximum value which can be held in a double.
It is described in [GLib(2.68.1) Reference Manual -- G\_MAXDOUBLE and G\_MINDOUBLE](https://developer-old.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Basic-Types.html#G-MINDOUBLE:CAPS).
You might think the lowest value of double is G\_MINDOUBLE, but it's not.
G\_MINDOUBLE is the minimum positive value which can be held in a double.
- The maximum value is G\_MAXDOUBLE.
- The default value is 0.0.
- `G_PARAM_READWRITE` is a flag.
`G_PARAM_READWRITE` means that the parameter is readable and writable.

For further information, refer to the GObject API reference.

- [GParamSpec and its subclasses](https://docs.gtk.org/gobject/index.html#classes)
- [g\_param\_spec\_double and similar functions](https://docs.gtk.org/gobject/index.html#functions)
- [GValue](https://docs.gtk.org/gobject/struct.Value.html)

GParamSpec is used for the registration for GObject properties.
This is extracted from tdouble.c in [src/tdouble6](tdouble6).

~~~C
#define PROP_DOUBLE 1
static GParamSpec *double_property = NULL;

static void
t_double_class_init (TDoubleClass *class) {
  GObjectClass *gobject_class = G_OBJECT_CLASS (class);

  gobject_class->set_property = t_double_set_property;
  gobject_class->get_property = t_double_get_property;
  double_property = g_param_spec_double ("value", "val", "Double value", -G_MAXDOUBLE, G_MAXDOUBLE, 0.0, G_PARAM_READWRITE);
  g_object_class_install_property (gobject_class, PROP_DOUBLE, double_property);
}
~~~

The variable `double_property` is static.
GParamSpec instance is assigned to `double_property`.

The function `g_object_class_install_property` installs a property.
It must be called after `set_property` and `get_property` methods are overridden.
These methods will be explained later.
The arguments are TDoubleClass class, PROP\_DOUBLE (property id) and GParamSpec instance.
Property id is used to identify the property in `tdouble.c`.
It is a positive integer.

## Overriding set\_property and get\_property class methods

Property values vary from instance to instance.
Therefore, the value is stored to each instance of the object.

The function `g_object_set` is given a value as an argument and stores the value.
But how does `g_object_set` know the instance to store?
It is compiled before the object is made.
So, it doesn't know where to store the value at all.
That part needs to be programmed by the writer of the object with overriding.

The function `g_object_set` first checks the property and value, then it creates GValue (generic value) from the value.
And it calls a function pointed by `set_property` in the class.
Look at the diagram below.

![Overriding `set_property` class method](../image/class_property1.png){width=15cm height=7.5cm}

The member `set_property` in GObjectClass class points `g_object_do_set_property` in GObject program, which is made by compiling `gobject.c`.
The GObjectClass part of the TDoubleClass structure (it is the same as TDoubleClass because TDoubleClass doesn't have its own area) is initialized by copying from the contents of GObjectClass.
Therefore, `set_property` in TDoubleClass class points `g_object_do_set_property` in GObject program.
But `g_object_do_set_property` doesn't store the value to the TDouble instance.
The writer of TDouble object makes `t_double_set_property` function in `tdouble.c`.
And assigns the address of `t_double_set_property` to `set_property` in TDoubleClass class.
It is shown with a red curve in the diagram.
As a result, `g_object_set` calls `t_double_set_property` instead of `g_object_do_set_property` (red dotted curve) and the value will be stored in the TDouble instance.
See the function `t_double_class_init` above.
It changes the member `gobject_class->set_property` to point the function `t_double_set_property`.
The function `g_object_set` sees the TDoubleClass and call the function pointed by the member `set_property`.

The program of `t_double_set_property` and `t_double_get_property` will shown later.

## GValue

GValue is generic value.
GValue consists of type and value.

The type is any Gtype.
The table below shows some GType, but not all.

|GType           |C type|type name |notes                  |
|:---------------|:-----|:---------|:----------------------|
|G\_TYPE\_CHAR   |char  |gchar     |                       |
|G\_TYPE\_BOOLEAN|int   |gboolean  |                       |
|G\_TYPE\_INT    |int   |gint      |                       |
|G\_TYPE\_FLOAT  |float |gfloat    |                       |
|G\_TYPE\_DOUBLE |double|gdouble   |                       |
|G\_TYPE\_STRING |      |gchararray|null-terminated Cstring|
|G\_TYPE\_PARAM  |      |GParam    |GParamSpec             |
|G\_TYPE\_OBJECT |      |GObject   |                       |
|G\_TYPE\_VARIANT|      |GVariant  |                       |

If the type of a GValue `value` is `G_TYPE_DOUBLE`, `value` can be get with `g_value_get_double` function.

~~~C
GValue value;
value = ... ... ... (a GValue object is assigned. Its type is double.)
double v;
v = g_value_get_double (&value);
~~~

Conversely, you can set GValue `value` with `g_value_set_double`.

~~~C
g_value_set_double (value, 123.45);
~~~

Refer to [GObject API Reference -- GValue](https://docs.gtk.org/gobject/struct.Value.html) for further information.

## t\_double\_set\_property and t\_double\_get\_property

`g_object_set` makes GValue from the value of the property given as an argument.
And calls a function pointed by `set_property` in the class.
The function is declared in GObjectClass structure.

~~~C
struct  _GObjectClass
{
  ... ... ...
  ... ... ...
  /* overridable methods */
  void       (*set_property)    (GObject        *object,
                                 guint           property_id,
                                 const GValue   *value,
                                 GParamSpec     *pspec);
  void       (*get_property)    (GObject        *object,
                                 guint           property_id,
                                 GValue         *value,
                                 GParamSpec     *pspec);
  ... ... ...
  ... ... ...
};
~~~

`t_double_set_property` just get the value from GValue `value` and store it to the TDouble instance.

@@@include
tdouble6/tdouble.c t_double_set_property
@@@

- 3: Casts `object` to TDouble object `self`.
- 6: Set `self->value`.
The assigned value is got with `g_value_get_double` function.

In the same way, `t_double_get_property` stores `self->value` to GValue.

@@@include
tdouble6/tdouble.c t_double_get_property
@@@

## Notify signal

GObject emits "notify" signal when a property is set.
When you connect "notify" signal to your handler, you can specify a detail which is the name of the property.
The detail is added to the signal name with the delimiter "::".

~~~C
g_signal_connect (G_OBJECT (d1), "notify::value", G_CALLBACK (notify_cb), NULL);
~~~

If you don't specify details, the handler is called whenever any properties are set.
So, usually the detail is set.

Notify signal doesn't mean that the value of the property is changed.
It is emitted even if the same value is set.
You might want to emit the notify signal only when the property is actually changed.
In that case, you define the GPramSpec with `G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY` flag.
Then, the notify signal isn't emitted automatically.
Instead you call `g_object_notify_by_pspec` function to emit "notify" signal explicitly when the value of the property is actually changed.

It is possible to make setter and getter for the property.
But if you just set the instance member in your setter, notify signal isn't emitted.

~~~C
void
t_double_set_value (TDouble *self, double value) {
  g_return_if_fail (T_IS_DOUBLE (self));

  self->value = value; /* Just set d->value. No "notify" signal is emitted. */
}
~~~

Users must be confused if they want to catch the "notify" signal.
One solution is use `g_object_set` in your setter.
Then, notify signal will be emitted even if a user uses the setter function.

~~~C
void
t_double_set_value (TDouble *d, double value) {
  g_return_if_fail (T_IS_DOUBLE (d));

  g_object_set (d, "value", value, NULL); /* Use g_object_set. "notify" signal will be emitted. */
}
~~~

The other solution is use `g_object_notify_by_pspec` to emit the signal explicitly.
Anyway, if you make a setter for your property, be careful about notify signal.

## Define more than one property

If you define more than one property, use an array of property id.
It is good for you to see Gtk source files such as `gtklabel.c`.
GtkLabel has 18 properties.

There's an example in [src/tdouble6](tdouble6) directory.

## Exercise

Make TInt object.
It is like TDouble but the value type is int.
Define "div-by-zero" signal and "value" property.

Compare your answer to the files in [src/tint](tint) directory.
